Lab0: Setting up github and self-introduction
## Intro!
Please provide a brief self-introduction below (year, hometown, favorite food, anything you would like to share with us!) to help us get to know you a little better :)

Hi All!

I'm  Chris, this is my first year in the DSI, I'm from (and am quarantined in) Watertown, MA, my favorite food is currently the molasses cookie from Flour bakery (https://fivesilverspoons.com/flour-bakerys-ginger-molasses-cookies/), and I'm editing this in vim right now. Looking forward to the rest of the semester!
